Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Allows you to receive near-real-time change notifications for a [drive][] and [list][] using [socket.io][].
Socket.io is a popular notifications library for JavaScript that utilizes WebSockets. To learn more, see [socket.io](https://socket.io).

### Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) object in the response body.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.subscription"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "id": "opaqueId-fj3hd7yf283jfk193726nvc2w3i2diemdu8",
  "notificationUrl": "https://f3hb0mpua.svc.ms/zbaehwg/callback?snthgk=1ff3-2345672zz831837523"
}
```

The `notificationUrl` returned is a socket.io endpoint URL.
To use it with a socket.io client, split the string on the `/callback?` token.
The part of the string before `/callback?` is the socket.io endpoint URL and the part of the string after is an opaque query string that must be given to the libary.

The following example shows how to use the `notificationUrl` with socket.io in JavaScript.

```javascript
// this is the notificationUrl returned from this API
var notificationUrl = "https://f3hb0mpua.svc.ms/zbaehwg/callback?snthgk=1ff3-2345672zz831837523";

// after the split, split[0] will be everything leading up to '/callback?' and split[1] will be everything after.
var split = notificationUrl.split("/callback?");

// 'io' comes from the socket.io client library
var socket = io(split[0], { query: split[1] });

// these examples log to the console.
// your app would provide its own callbacks
socket.on("connect", ()=>console.log("Connected!"));
socket.on("notification", (data)=>console.log("Notification!", data));
```
